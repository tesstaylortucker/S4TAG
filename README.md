Random Trait &amp; Aspiration Generator for The Sims 4 Game

This is a Python tkinter app that generates random traits and aspirations for the Sims 4.  Different traits apply to different Sim life states, so you are able to generate traits for Young Adults and older, Teens, Children, and Toddlers separately.  You can also generate random aspirations for Children, and random aspirations for Teens and older separately.  For example, the trait "Family-Oriented" can only be assigned to Young Adults and older, so the Child and Teen generators do not include this.  

The app opens a tkinter window and has buttons for all of the available generators.  Files can be copied or downloaded into one folder, and the executable can be turned into a shortcut for your desktop that will run the application without any outside programming compilers.  The lists are read from files, so its important that the original .exe is in the same folder.
